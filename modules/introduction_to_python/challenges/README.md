### Challenge requirements

#### Challenge 1:
Create a program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter two whole numbers
2. Stores each number in a variable
3. Outputs the two numbers added together
4. Outputs the second number subtracted from the first
5. Outputs the two numbers multiplied together
6. Outputs the second number divided by the first

#### Challenge 2:
Create a program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter three strings
2. Stores the results in variables
3. Creates a list containing the lengths of each string
4. Stores the list in a variable
5. Outputs the list
6. For each string, outputs
    * the length (from the stored list)
    * the first three letters
    * the last three letters
    
#### Challenge 3:
Create a program that does the following:

1. Prints out "Rocket test: " and the current date and time
2. Prompts the user to enter a positive number
3. Counts down from the entered number to zero, outputting each number
4. Outputs "Blast Off!"
5. Outputs "Test completed: " and the current date and time

#### Challenge 4:
Create a program that does the following:

1. Has a conversation with the user
2. Stores information about the user - name, age, favourite colour, etc.
